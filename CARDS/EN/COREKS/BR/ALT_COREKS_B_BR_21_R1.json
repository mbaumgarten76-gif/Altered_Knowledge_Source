The Eidolon's copper cuirass shines in the setting sun, and the tip of his lance glimmers in the twilight glow. I carefully monitor every one of his movements, searching for the slightest flaw. But that's easier said than done. Even though he's set aside his helmet and shield, the fearsome reach of his weapon is danger enough on its own. To trip him up and outmatch him with my jian, I'll need to reduce the distance between us and get inside his guard. But how? Suddenly, he strikes. I block at the last second, rotating my wrist slightly to attempt a disruption of my own.\n\nBut as I prepare to hit him, his fist clips me on the jaw and I stumble back, realizing he's dropped his weapon to more easily take me with his bare fists. I stagger, then roll to get myself back on guard. But Achilles is faster. Catching his lance on his foot, he launches it in the air to grab it, then spins it around while taking a step toward me. I dodge the shaft that almost hits me, but not the kick that lands right in my ribs. I plant my weapon in the ground to avoid falling, struggling with all my might not to give in to the panic from my gasping breath and spinning vision. When I started the fight, I had hoped I could exploit his heel, but I didn't know it would be so hard to reach."

Depending on the effect, it might mean the effect may simply do nothing, or it might mean they must target one of their own Characters."

If you choose not to, and there's no valid target, the effect might do nothing.\n\nDon't forget that Characters you control may be valid targets: if you choose not to pay the extra mana (or if you can't), you may have to target them!"
