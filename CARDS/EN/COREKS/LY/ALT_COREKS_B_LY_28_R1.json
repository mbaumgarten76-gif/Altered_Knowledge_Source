I'll figure something out, so I might as well help him out. I concentrate and close my eyes to call the spirit of the Bifrost to me. I have to be careful not to get mixed up with the Leprechaun's rainbow and his pot of gold, his crock of loot. With all that booty, I could buy loads of... no, no, no! I open my eyes, and of course, that's what I've got. A pot full of cash, which is definitely not what I need right now. Of course, as soon as you tell your brain not to think of something, it thinks of that exact thing. Typical.\n\nSo, I concentrate again, focusing on an iridescent road, a fiery ribbon with colors that intertwine to form a bridge in the sky... And this time it works! No little green man, no red beard or four-leaf clover, but instead a rainbow winding between the clouds. All right, quick, let's go! I signal to my Eidolons to jump onto it so its currents can carry them to my little Alter Ego. One by one, I watch as they're swept away on the pink and blue torrents, slipping down the sky river like they're on a water slide, slaloming between the stars and lightning. Perched on her clockodile, the Eidolon of Fen's friend Aru tucks a Mush under her arm and jumps into the torrent. I hope they get to the other side safe and sound, because it won't be easy to fish them out if they fall overboard."
