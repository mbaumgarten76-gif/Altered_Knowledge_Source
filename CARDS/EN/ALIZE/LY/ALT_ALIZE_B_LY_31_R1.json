          "text": "While exploring among the foliage, I discover something else: large, webbed paw prints. The distance between each step suggests that the owner of these feet must be pretty big. I follow the tracks. As I continue the hunt, lost in thought, the Wind carries a whistle to me... or a warbling to be more precise. It's rhythmic, very repetitive, like a tune you might hum nonchalantly while doing something else. A feeling of satisfaction emanates from this stunted melody, a declaration of joy. I move closer to the source of the sound. Crowbar covers me from the rear, of course. Hidden behind a barrier of snow-covered fir trees, I finally see a sort of clearing strewn with all sorts of odds and ends. A jumble of items lies on the ground: a bucket with binoculars inside, a flashlight, a pile of books with a mug on top... Taking stock of everything feels like an Ordis nursery rhyme: It makes my head spin.\n\nBut it's not a garbage dump. All the items are in perfect condition. And besides, I recognize some of them! Those headphones, that's Tamati's! It was stolen from the camp a couple of days ago. One, two, three, four things... With horror, I realize this is a thief's den. And then I see a strange figure enter the clearing. It's an elegant cross between a magpie and a penguin. Clearly pleased with himself, he waddles around, carrying on his back a pack filled with items as disparate as those strewn across the ground. He's even wearing a hat I remember from another expedition. And I'm confident that its owner didn't have webbed feet and an orange beak. He's probably just dropping off his plunder from his latest loot run. I look at what he's carrying: cartographers' papers, chocolate eggs... No! He's also got the rolling pin that Hestia uses. How will she make those delicious cookies now?"
