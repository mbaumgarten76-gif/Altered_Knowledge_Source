But I don't really need to think that hard about it. If I send them the wrong way, it'll just get the blood flowing in their legs, and don't they say that walking is good for the mind as well as the body? It only takes me a brief moment to materialize a will-o'-the-wisp in front of me. The little pink spark starts to glow in the fading light, tinting the ice with the most beautiful pink shimmer. With a little blow, I push it towards the explorers, and off it goes. I watch it rushing down the slope, darting between the coral flowers like a ghostly soap bubble. If all goes well, my wispy assistant will lead them a little astray on roads less traveled.\n\nThere's something magical about watching the will-o'-the-wisp flit around as it approaches the scouts, weaving between the frozen petals like a bloated firefly. Soon it will start its little dance to take them off the beaten path. Although, there aren't actually any marked paths here. What if they refuse to follow it? Well, I'll just send more. They won't be able to resist their otherworldly allure. After all, this is the stuff of legends. I've used these little glowing balls many times in my shows to distract or captivate the audience. And it's worked perfectly each time. There's no reason why these fools would resist their spell. I actually feel a little sorry for them. They'll be very upset when they realize they are lost in the wilderness, far away from their objective. But that's still a lot better than stumbling right into the Belisenki nest they were heading directly for..."

Appearing as small flames without smoke in swamps, dark forests and cemeteries, these malevolent spirits sometimes have a reputation of luring the reckless into danger. In reality, these apparitions could be explained by such normal physical phenomena as combusting gas from decomposing organic materials, or bioluminescence."
