Oddball flies around the vehicle, clearly concerned. He chirps shrill warnings, and I get it: It's a delicate operation. It was a bit of a crazy idea to bring the armored vehicle here instead of taking things a bit more cautiously. On the other hand, I completely understand why the foreman didn't want to part with this resource and insisted that we bring it with our gear at all costs. I clench my fists as the Reprocessor approaches the edge of the cliff. Its tracks scrape away the powdery snow and skid on a layer of ice. It's just a few inches from the falling into the void... The slightest mistake, and it could be...\n\nI bite my lips as I see the rocky ledge crack. I pull my Construct out of my pocket. As the stone splits, I tap furiously and manage to apply the idea of sturdiness to the rock. But I rushed it and did a clumsy job. All I managed to do was gain a few seconds... A sheet of snow breaks away from the edge and cascades down below, breaking up on the sharp rocks before melting like a stream into the deep valley. I hope no one is down there. But I can't lose focus. I materialize some metallic struts and frames... all the ideas I can throw at the cracking rock face. At the same time, the drivers of the armored vehicle shift into reverse to get out of danger, no longer worrying if they'll hit something. Far below me, the ground is starting to rumble."
