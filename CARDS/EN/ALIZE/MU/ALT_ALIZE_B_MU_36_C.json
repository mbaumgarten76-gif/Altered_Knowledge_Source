As beautiful as it is, it's also very dangerous for the most fragile flora and fauna in this environment: the arctic poppies, blueberries, rockfoils, cottongrass… I hesitate for a moment, but Spike pokes me in the rear. Ouch! Yes, yes, we're going to get out there and help the unfortunate victims of this sudden wintry blast. Don't worry your prickly little head about that. I grab my cane, a big pair of insulated boots, an extra scarf, and we're off on our rescue mission. With my Chimaera along to help me, I head for the biggest snowdrifts to look for those in need of help. I hope others will think of doing the same. The cold is intense, so we'll have to be quick. All of a sudden, I get a strange feeling. Sure, the forest is always quiet after it snows… But this time it's really too quiet. Even the birds seem to be gone.\n\nI continue on my rescue mission, keeping this strange silence in mind. Then Spike discovers the answer to the mystery. He leads me along a narrow path, and as we round a bend, I hear the chirping of birds. Overwhelmed by the cold, they've taken refuge in the arms of a debonair fellow covered in thick white fur, with a bright blue face and a pair of black horns like those of an ibex. The Yeti seems thrilled to act as a perch for his tiny feathered friends as they huddle together against his chest. Sitting in the snow with a broad grin that reveals his long canines, he seems happy to keep the birds company and listen to their joyful songs. Reassured, I leave the Eidolon to bring warmth to the chilly woods, and resume my mission to help those who haven't been fortunate enough to find such refuge."
