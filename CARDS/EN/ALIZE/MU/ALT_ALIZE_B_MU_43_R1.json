          "text": "I take the packet of magic beans that Arjun gave me before I left and slip it into my pocket. They told me that I just had to infuse them with an idea to make the idea sprout forth into the world, and I believe them. As far as growing a complex idea like a ladder of ivy or a bridge made of reeds, I imagine I'll need a bit of practice to achieve the desired results. Still, I'm grateful to Arjun for this welcome bit of help. Especially since, if it works, I'll be able to leave a lot of my gear in the shed and travel light. Stepping away from the campfire, I find a little clearing where I can conduct my experiments. Might as well start simple… maybe with a little basin I can use to wash my face by the stream. I concentrate and form a clear idea in my head, then anchor it in one of the beans.\n\nThe bean suddenly starts to sprout at a truly unbelievable speed. Then the fast-growing stems and leaves intertwine, forming a sort of jug made of plant matter. Maybe I didn't get the original idea quite right? I dip the container into the stream, breaking through the thin crust of ice to reach the water below. I can see that it's fairly watertight, although a few thin streams of water are leaking out between the network of stems that make up its whole surface. It's acceptable, but flawed. Let's see how I manage with my second try. As I look through my possessions, I suddenly realize that my tent is the one item that takes up the most space and weight in my pack. Could that work? I throw down the second bean, imagining what a tent made of leaves and petals might look like. If this attempt works out well, I'll be sure to show Arjun the results of my experiments to thank them for this gift."
