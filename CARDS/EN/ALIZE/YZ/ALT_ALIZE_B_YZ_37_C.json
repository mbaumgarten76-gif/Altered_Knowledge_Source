I'll need to call on the combined power of Phonomancy and Kinemancy to effectively detect their approach and cut them down in mid-flight, using everything I've got to protect the rest of the Corps. So I close my eyes and start listening to the howling of the snowstorm, isolating the sound of the wind by canceling out the warriors' shouts and the clatter of claws on shields. There, amid the turmoil, a thin stream of air cuts through the maelstrom like a hot wire through butter. Over there, one of them soars like a falcon and watches its prey from above. I start to interpret the sounds around me, and most importantly, to distinguish them from the tapestry of other sounds enveloping me… By using Mana moths at specific bottleneck points, I can lure the Belisenki to go wherever I want.\n\nI call on Eidomancy to manifest ghostly limbs, which I then use to trace more complex Gestures in the air. I will tame the storm that they're using as cover and turn it into their burial shroud. The wind that shelters them will become the tool of their destruction. Gust. One of them is torn to pieces, and its body tumbles through the air, carried away by the tornado I'm forming. Ice. Another one's wings frost over, and it plunges towards the ground before being sucked into the whirlwind in turn. I don't know how long I can keep this up. Mana is running through my fingers like sand. I see Akesha looking at me, shielding her face and yelling something I can't hear. I realize that the hurricane is continuing to grow, that it's escaping my control. It's not only lashing at my enemies but also at those I'm trying to protect. And finally, I understand. Something is feeding my own power, triggering a chain reaction…"
