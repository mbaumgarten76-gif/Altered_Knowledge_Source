While every part of me is trying to prevent a collision, Skadi has the audacity to perform acrobatics with the nonchalance of a true expert. She moves effortlessly. She just glides, easily and naturally. It's annoying... and a little demoralizing. I'm an expert in the art of movement, but this is too much for me. I pant for breath, hands gripping the poles tightly. She turns towards me without paying attention to the obstacles below, and treats me to a display of the moves she wants me to do. I'm about to respond when I realize a tree is far too close to me. I have to plant a pole instantly to quickly change course and avoid catastrophe.\n\nShe laughs and gives me a thumbs up. And then she's off again, in a single bound. Fascinated, I watch her graceful aerial ballet. Idiot! I didn't see the bump that she just jumped! I go flying, limbs everywhere, legs above my head... I fall inelegantly into a snowdrift, which saves me from a more painful crash, but my ego has been severely damaged. The Eidolon stops gently next to me, while I struggle to get up, fighting with my skis. She shakes her head, flapping her long braid of blonde hair. With a smirk on her face, she patiently waits until I'm standing up before teasing me about the trick I just pulled off. Brushing the snow off my clothes, I try to find a witty comeback. No. Best to keep a low profile. I feel like even the snowmen around the camp are laughing at me."

The name Scandinavia, which could mean \"Skadi's island\", may be named after her. After the death of her father, killed by the gods of Asgard, she takes up arms against them to seek vengeance. But the Aesir, aware of her just cause, pardon her rebellion and offer her suitable compensation, even placing Thjazi's eyes in the sky in the form of stars shining in the heavens."
