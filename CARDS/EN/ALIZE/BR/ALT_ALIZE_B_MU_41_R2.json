          "text": "I hum a little Muna nursery rhyme as I dig in the dirt with my hands. It's my little ritual whenever I plant something. Putting seeds in the soil is always a sacred moment. Especially when that soil is so unsuitable for sprouting, when the cold leaves the plants more inclined to keep sleeping. It's important to take the time to clear a furrow deep enough to give the future plant access to the nutrients it needs and life-saving protection from the soil. A good start is essential, because everything that follows depends on the care given in these early moments. I finish shaping the future cocoon as I kneel, carefully clearing the snow and kneading the earth to loosen and warm it. I add a bit of Mana, but only a touch. There's no need to force nature's magic along. It's a slow process, but one that shouldn't be rushed. When the soil is finally ready, I dip my hand into the little leather pouch where I keep my seeds. I delicately separate them in my palm with one finger.\n\nWhatever their size, whatever their shape, they're all perfect. Rin had found them in the bottom of one of my pots when we were taking down the floral tent before striking camp. We decided to share them, like I had done with Teija. The famous beans, now with my own touch of magic... I wipe my brow. Everything's ready. This is the moment of truth, when I place the seeds in the ground. I finish my ritual as the Mana flows through the seed. I shiver as I feel the magic start to work, sensing their Skein connecting to the rest of nature. The germination accelerates, the cotyledons open, the radicle emerges, and the plumule unfurls with a golden sparkle. Though I've witnessed this scene hundreds of times, I'm still awestruck every time. If only I could offer the Spindle Tree a rebirth like this… As the first leaves appear, I leave the new sprout to follow the life path dictated by the idea embedded within it. I move on to the next furrow and repeat my sacred ritual."
