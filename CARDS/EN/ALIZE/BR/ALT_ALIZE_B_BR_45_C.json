OK, a line of dialog: \"During expeditions, I often need a pick-me-up.\" Yep, I can definitely say that with conviction... Haha. It's funny when I think about it. A few months ago, I was a nobody; and now, they're asking me to star in altavista ads. I can just image what Gault and the others will say when they see my face filling the screen during the show. Blah blah blah. I swallow what's in my mouth and bite into the candy bar again. \"To regain my energy, I always keep an Eat Me bar in my pocket!\" Yep, classic. I say the phrase a few times in my head. \"To regain my energy, nothing beats...\" No, it's \"I always fill my pockets...\"\n\nOK, focus, Kojo. I scrunch up the wrapper and stuff it in my pocket without really thinking. Then I swallow the last mouthful. While reading the rest of the script, I feel around to find a new bar. \"With Eat Me, the bar that makes you grow, I'm playing in the big leagues!\" Blah blah blah, and then it finishes with the slogan: \"Eat Me: The little break for big moments!\" OK, easy, especially because it gives me a nice break. I stuff a whole bar in my mouth and carry on eating happily. Wow, these are good, but they don't half make you thirsty! I turn to the assistant to ask for some water, only to see her drop her notepad with a horrified look on her face. What? I stare at her and look around me to see what I did wrong. And then I realize that I've just eaten half a dozen of the candy bars I'm meant to be promoting. Hmm. What is it they were saying about big moments? Big in what way?"
