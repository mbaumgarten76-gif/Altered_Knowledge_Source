The Ouroboros starts up, and its ring begins to spin as I ask my quartermaster what troops we have in addition to the Tagmata foot soldiers. I curse under my breath, but don't let it show as I listen to his explanations. Because of the troubles caused by the Belisenki, our contingents are already spread thin. I know we can count on a Bravos company, recently returned from an expedition, as a strike force. But it won't be able to cover the entire search area on its own, especially as the avalanche appears to have descended far down into the valley. While I can also deploy a few additional rescuers, we'll need a lot more if we hope to find any survivors.\n\nFinding another company will take too much time... What resources do we have available? Hmm, what if...? I suddenly turn to my chief mechanic and ask how many Brassbugs are on the Ouroboros. From his response, it seems that my idea just might work, even it sounds completely crazy. I want to parachute in a swarm of Brassbugs from the main bay... It might not be the most elegant strategy, but time is running out. I give my orders to my second-in-command. If he thinks those orders are insane, he doesn't show it. We fly through the clouds and head for the snowy pass. We'll be in position in less than a minute, but I know every second counts if there's any hope of rescuing survivors. Word comes to me that all the Brassbugs have been mobilized in the main hangar. Nothing left to do but cross our fingers that the plan works... and watch a horde of Brassbugs get dropped like a shower of shooting stars."
