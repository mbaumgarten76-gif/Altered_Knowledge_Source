With a powerful downstroke, I make the strings of my guitar thrum as I slowly bang my head to the rhythm of the bass. I raise my arm and throw the horns up to the crowd. That's the end of the intro. Ready to get heavy? All right, let's go! My fingers start to fly, and my pick dances over the metal strings, cranking out fat electric notes. Raaaaaaaaa, this is awesome! The speakers begin to blare as Boona bellows into the microphone. Bleeeeuuargh!!! The audience is already entranced in front of the stage. It's a sea of humans... and not just humans, either. A mosh pit is forming in the crowd. Go on, let it all out! 'Cuz yeah, we're going all out too for our last concert in the capital!\n\nFen grabs her microphone and starts to sing. Aaa-ooooh! I swear, we're going to set this place on fire tonight! She and I take it in turns. Verse, chorus. A vocal attack from her, like a release, and then I drive the nails into the coffin with my riffs. Tamati wields their drum sticks like their life depends on it. Tonight, it feels like all our lives depend on it! Bass drum and snare drum, cymbals and syncopated beats. OK, now we're starting to build up some momentum. Again, again! Now it's time for the bridge. Tadum tadum, tadum tadum. Fen hypnotizes the crowd with a long lament... Fever, intoxication. But it's not over, we bring it back in. It's time to rock. It's time for my solo. I curl into a half-crouch, dancing my hands over the neck of my electric guitar, sending forth strident notes and complex chords. All right, the crowd's ready for me to completely ad lib. Go! I feel the flames licking through the audience like a wave of energy that fills and feeds me. And you know what? It's time to pour some fuel on this fire!"
