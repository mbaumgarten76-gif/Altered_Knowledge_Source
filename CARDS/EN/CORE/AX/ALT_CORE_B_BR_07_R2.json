She taps her foot to knock the dirt off her soles, and I catch myself nervously tapping my foot as well. Next to me, someone rises and shouts out her name. But even just a half-step away from him, I struggle to hear the fan's voice over the deafening roar of the crowd. I look at the gallery around me. People have flocked to the Colosseum to witness the Altrun final. An incredible crowd. Both teams' flags are flying in the stands, and their supporters' voices are getting more insistent… It's about to begin, and we can all feel it. I suddenly realize the feat my team has achieved by qualifying at the 11th hour. If we win this one, it'll be the title.\n\nI see the referee take their position on the field by the racers, the Alterers of both teams on high alert and doing stretches… The gunshot rings out across the Colosseum. The tracers rush forward, as everyone in the stands move to the edge of their seats and cheer. From their box, both teams' Alterers modify the field to help their racers advance and make things hard for their opponents. To the spectators' amazement, the course keeps shifting and transforming… And of course, so do the tracers, who leap, twist, and flit, ever adapting to the changing environment. Their acrobatics elicit gasps, while their falls draw frustrated cursing… Gradually, they climb the promontory that was raised in the middle of the arena, with the goal of reaching the top. Go, Carmela! Get that damn flag and bring home the cup!"
