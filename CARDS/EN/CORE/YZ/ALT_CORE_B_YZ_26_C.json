          "text": "I watch with horror as the soldiers of the Aegis are swallowed by the waves. The Kraken ravages the Ordis ranks, and I'm desperate to join in and help them. But Taru is clinging to my arm and he turns to me with tearful eyes. With one of his tentacles, he points to the other side of the battlefield. But I can't understand the words he speaks to me. \"Elsewhere. The threat is coming from elsewhere.\" His suckers adhere to my skin, preventing me from incanting. I see a figure disappear in the swell and beg my Alter Ego to let go of me. He finally relents, pouting sullenly as his legs release their grip and hang limply. Down below, the sea is pure chaos. The foam boils, the swells crash into the cliffs, and the water spirals like an emptying bathtub. But that's where I must go.\n\nI let myself fall and dive beneath the surface. I immediately feel the currents tugging at me, but I manage to hold my breath. I let myself be dragged to the depths, to the fathomless darkness of the sea bed. Holding my breath, I use a combination of gestures to summon a portal to dry land. I feel the currents changing direction as the swirling water is sucked into the portal I've half-opened along with the soldiers who have been swallowed by the waves. I need to keep it open. I must keep it open so they can pass through. The pressure on my lungs becomes increasingly unbearable, and black spots dance on the edge of my vision. But I can't give up yet. Taru suddenly wraps himself around my head and releases an air bubble into the cavity he's created with his gelatinous body. I take in a big gulp of air and cough to spit out the water I've swallowed through my nose."
