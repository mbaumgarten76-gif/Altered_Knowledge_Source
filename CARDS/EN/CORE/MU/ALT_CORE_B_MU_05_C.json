He splashes all around, maybe pursuing silvery fish or the little green crawfish that people sometimes come here to fish. I turn around and lecture him. That's not what we came here for today. He looks disappointed, his ears flattening behind his head and his lips pouting, but he joins me anyway. Today we have an offering to contribute, and Mom said not to do anything else before leaving it. I climb a slippery, lichen-covered rock, Nauraa helping me along with his nose. I lift myself up to a little waterfall between the rocks, then squeeze into a narrow canyon that is shaded and cool. Meanwhile, Nauraa leaps over me and watches me walk from up above. He keeps his gaze on me, his tongue hanging out.\n\nI finally make it to the little Fox Spirit altar. I clasp my hands and do a quick prayer before placing a few sticky rice sweets on it. I place the dumplings in a pyramid stack on the lacquered wood plate and call on the deity, closing my eyes like Mom taught me. Behind me I hear the clatter of a few pebbles in the swirling stream, and the jingling of a few bells. I turn around to see Kitsune playing with her ball — her Hoshi-no-Tama. She marvels at the pile of sweet and savory dango, a mischievous grin lighting up her face. She hops over to me and gives me her ball, before gulping down one of the dumplings. She chews her treat for a while to better savor it. Then she rummages through her bag and places a few glittering fish on the ground, making Nauraa drool. She turns to me and hands me something wrapped in an oak leaf."

          "text": "Often considered Inari's messenger, the Kitsune — or fox spirit — is a yōkai that, like its rival the Tanuki, gains the ability to transform upon reaching 100 years old. Appearing in many tales of Japanese folklore, the Kitsune, which can sport up to nine tails the more powerful and venerable it becomes, is often portrayed as a trickster spirit. Whether purely out of spite or to punish humans for being vain or greedy, they use illusions to lure people in and play tricks on them. Yet Kitsune also sometimes help and protect those who take care of them or treat them with respect."
