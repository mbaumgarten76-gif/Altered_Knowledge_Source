I descend the steps past the rows of seats and head towards the lecture podium. Quetzalcóatl wipes his glasses and sets them down on the lectern, then turns to me. His scales tremble, and his feathers change color just like a chameleon's skin. Signaling for me to follow, the Eidolon moves towards the annex behind the auditorium where his offices are. I ask Mack to keep watch and warn me if any intruders try to spy on us. He squeaks to show me he understands and settles on a desk, pulling a handful of sunflower seeds from his pouch to nibble on while waiting. Out of consideration, I ask him to clean up after himself, but all he does is show me his rear end.\n\nWith a sigh, I close the door behind me, while Quetzalcóatl opens a chest and takes out a cylindrical case made from metal and leather. He opens it and lifts out an old parchment. He places it on the table and carefully unfurls it with his talons. Then he asks me to approach. Other than perhaps Thoth, few can claim to be as learned in all of Asgartha, and I'm confident about what he has found among the shelves of the Sanctum's forbidden library. I put my glasses on and slip on a pair of gloves to avoid damaging the precious relic. Then I start to read the document, on which the ink has faded with time. The logbook of Baird y Idris, last Shepherd of the Sunset Tribe... Every day, he religiously noted down the azimuths, coordinates and location of the City of Scholars. Looks like that city will be the first stop for the Rediscovery Endeavor."
