I consider the outstretched hand of the commander and sit down across from him, pushing out the tails of my coat while my griffon lies down near the window. A little game can't hurt, and I must admit I'm eager to pit myself against him. I can't appear timid, so I immediately go on the offensive by moving a pawn to d4. I watch my opponent. He considers my queen pawn opening, not the least bit intimidated. With a slight smile, Kakoba takes his knight and places it on f6 to stop me from taking the center at e4. Indian Defense: a classic. OK, I'll need to be patient. Pawn to c4. Are we moving towards a Gr√ºnfeld defense or a Benoni defense? He immediately responds with a pawn to e6. We size each other up, sparring after our first strikes...\n\nI answer with a knight to c3, and then he moves a pawn to c5. I scrutinize his face, trying to work out the strategy he's trying to use. But to do so, I need to probe his psyche. To counter him effectively, I must ignore all the facades and deceptions. What do I know about him? As both a soldier and scholar, I know he's well-rounded. I know he's a strong supporter of Avkan ruun-Heshkari, as well as a wise, bold and stubborn politician. Instinctively, I feel he's likely to provoke me. But he knows that's my temperament too. If I were him, the wise choice would be to lie low and ambush me, triggering the trap by relying on my own tactical mistakes. But given the context, this is no mere chess game either. It's an interview, an audition. It's a way for us to introduce ourselves to each other, to show who we really are. Very well, let's show him, Wingspan."
