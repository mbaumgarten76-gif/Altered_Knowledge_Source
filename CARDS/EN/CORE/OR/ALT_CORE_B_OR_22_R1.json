Regardless, I need his help to decipher this cryptic and antiquated manuscript. Of all the books, those about the Tumult Nomads are probably the most precious and most delicate, in all senses of the word. But rather than being surprised that I have this valuable tome in my possession, Thoth starts to leaf through the pages, tilting his head to better decipher its contents. Then he dips his quill in the inkwell and starts to transcribe certain passages. If the fates are smiling upon us, these memoirs will contain a powerful idea we can all rally around, and towards which the very principle of the Rediscovery Endeavor could gravitate.\n\nThoth hands me page after page containing the fragments he has translated. I read them carefully, reflecting on how each bit of information could help Avkan. Of course, there are interesting mentions of the future of the lost tribe and intriguing anecdotes about the Shepherds of each caravan. But there's nothing that could lend weight to the aims of the great endeavor, or truly measure up to the scope of what we hope to accomplish. I sigh and rub my eyes. On the other side of the bay window, the sunlight of the day has turned to the coppery glow of dusk. Thoth hands me a new page. I read it once, and then once more to be sure I've understood the words correctly. \"The City of Scholars, where the source of the Tumult is engraved...\" My hands are shaking. The source of the Tumult? Finding its origin... There's no reason more compelling than that!"

Because of his impartiality, Thoth was also given the role of presiding over the tribunal of Osiris – which judges the dead – alongside Anubis."
