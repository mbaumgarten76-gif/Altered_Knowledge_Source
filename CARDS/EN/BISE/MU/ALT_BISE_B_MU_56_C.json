          "text": "393 AC - As I rush down the hill, weaving through ears of wild wheat, I notice that Arjun is sitting on a stump and chatting with Flore's Eidolon. When we were in the Storhvit, they had told me about their niece who had remained in Asgartha. I stop running, thinking that it's probably best if I don't interrupt them, despite my disappointment. Because this is obviously an intimate moment, like when I used to summon the Eidolon of my father. I change direction and head to the orchard to see if I can steal a pear, a pomegranate or maybe an orange… But that just leads to more disappointment. Gran Bwa is there, surrounded by a cloud of pollinating bumblebeets. And he probably wouldn't be too happy if he caught me foraging around his fruit trees. Unless… I search my pockets and find a cake of solidified Sap and a few tubers from down below.\n\nAll I need now is to find some rum… which won't be easy, considering I'm still underage. No, I'll need to find another solution. For a brief moment, I consider asking Nev to help me, but I shake my head. It always ends in disaster when I call on her… I watch him from afar, trying to spot an opportunity I can exploit. I watch him go from tree to tree. Sometimes it's just to give them a hug, and other times he spends a little more time \"chatting\" with them. Basically, he's just ensuring they have everything they need to flourish. A bleat suddenly makes me jump, and I turn around to find myself face to face with a fluffy sheep. It is accompanied by a young shepherd eating an apple. He instinctively offers me one, as though he knew exactly what I was planning."
