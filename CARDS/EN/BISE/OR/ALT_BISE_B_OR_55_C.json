Infrastructure design: unsatisfactory, as the kitchen is open to the outside. Overall cleanliness of the premises: unsatisfactory, but that's to be expected with thousands of people parading through the establishment every day. Staff hygiene: could do better, especially the hairy cook, who should wear gloves.
