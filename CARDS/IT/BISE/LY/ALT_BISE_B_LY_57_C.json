He is the elder brother who teaches and protects, and his commands resound like warnings to all those who wander through the labyrinth of life. Each choice is a turning point, and each path taken leads towards the center of the network. The goal is not to get there, but to delay the inevitable end for as long as possible. That's why I am bound to listen to him, for my own choices are essential to what lies ahead. Kibble nestles his head in the crook of my neck, sensing my own misguided ways and attempting to comfort me. I myself stand at the threshold to the Maze, its mouth wide open like an animal's jaws or an empty grave, and I'm preparing to dive in. But in the City of Scholars, it's best to show a little wisdom. Wisdom is what I need right now, and some certainty that my choices are the right ones.\n\nThroughout the long trip through the Storhvit, I was able to spend some good time with Fen. We talked for hours, and I started to get to know her a lot better. She has her grandmother's innocence and trusting kindness. And yet, even though I don't think her quest serves any interests beyond the ideals of a naive dream, it's… problematic. Who started her on this journey? Who pointed her along this road? I'd hate to be the one who showed her the center of the maze. I certainly don't want that. But what alternative is there? Make her my ally? Put her back on the right path? I give Kibble a gentle scratch behind the ears. He's fallen in love with the kid too. And that's why I'm seeking your counsel, Man in the Maze. I need you to act as my guide. Help me to navigate the winding paths of existence..."

He is the I'itoi, the man in the maze, who provides many gifts and much knowledge to human beings. The maze he watches over is the maze of life. All human beings wander it, and at the end of their existence, they arrive at its center, where they have one last chance to look back at the path they've taken to get there. A door then opens to lead them on to the next world."
