          "text": "393 AC - OK, looking at it closely, it's a bit like a school bag. But inside, there's all the essential gear you need for a long trip to the depths. And that includes what you need to get out quickly if the situation turns ugly when you're down there. Flashlight, compass, first-aid kit, freeze-dried rations… I watch the elevator climb to the surface of the chasm, winched up by a crane far above. The rails creak as our only means of returning to the open air moves ever further away. I breathe deeply, slapping my cheeks to stay focused on the job ahead. I know that the Muna are dealing with the Undergrowth, and the Ordis historians with the City's living areas. As for us, we need to explore everywhere to find veins of Sap. When we were out in the freezing environment of Storhvit, we had a few containers of the precious liquid we could use, but only enough for a little experimentation.\n\nNow, the goal wasn't research, but to collect as much as possible to use as a power replacement — at least temporarily — for Kelon. Sap… I shake my head. And from a world tree, at that… When Treyst had told me what Arjun had said, I'd had a reverse \"eureka\" moment where I'd realized that we'd had everything under our noses the whole time without being able to see it. Judging by his face, Treyst was also annoyed with himself for being so blind to what was ultimately obvious. I check the contents of the bag one last time while making a mental note of what I have available. Oddball suddenly beeps, and I see it too. Something's moving in there. A little head appears, looking all around. I burst out laughing. I don't know if it was looking for something in particular or, like a cat with a box, if it had decided that this was the ideal place for a nap, but the Brassbug seems a little disconcerted by where it had found itself. Tough luck, little guy. You're with me now."
