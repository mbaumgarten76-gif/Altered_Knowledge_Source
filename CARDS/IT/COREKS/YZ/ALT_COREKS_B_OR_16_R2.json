          "text": "The arguing has reached a fever pitch in the Court. The judge brings down his gavel to demand silence in the room. The Misericordia lawyer sits down next to me with a somber expression. He must know the game is already up. My surly attitude certainly didn't help to garner much sympathy from the citizen jury. I maintain a look of arrogance and disdain, looking down my nose at the jurors with scorn. I might as well go all in and play the loathing card. It's the prosecutor's turn to rise. She coughs to clear her throat. She is still young and seems to float in her loose tunic. As she approaches the lectern, her bear-shaped keyring jangles with each step. Her robes brush the ground as she climbs onto the dais, while her blond hair sways nonchalantly behind her.\n\nBut despite her innocent appearance, she launches into a harsh diatribe against me. Her arguments hit the mark, of course, and she delivers them like hammer blows. There was enough evidence to convict me: attempted corruption, threats and kickbacks. She returns often to my meeting with Robin Hood, when I tried to force the hand of the Isura banking institution. Naturally, I had spread the rumor that there was a mole in my party, an informer in our ranks. But no one knew that the traitor was me. The prosecutor turns to the judge to request my immediate removal and to make me unelectable for five years. And that suits me just fine. That sentence would seriously rattle Avkan's opponents, of whom I was the leader, and nicely open the way for him to realize his dream – our dream."
