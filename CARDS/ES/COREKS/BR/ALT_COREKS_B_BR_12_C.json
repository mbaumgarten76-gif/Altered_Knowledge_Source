          "text": "\"You have to feed on what others give you.\" That's what Hua Mulan had said. I didn't take her literally when she offered this bit of advice, thinking she was merely referring to the lessons I could gain from each of my instructors, to the experience I accumulated with each battle fought. But I'm beginning to understand what she really meant. I was capable of drawing upon my Alter Ego's nature to move at the speed of light. I was capable of delivering charged blows to deaden my enemies' limbs. But it wasn't only because of my bond with Surge. It was because I was consuming part of his being to make it my own. And with every Eidolon I called upon, a part of his power was transferred to me, to make me stronger.\n\nMulan gets into position, brandishing her jian like a wasp's stinger. Her eyes are calm as a pond sheltered from the wind, her body motionless as a marble statue. She comes alive suddenly, dashing toward me. Right, left, down. Her blows are probing my defenses for a weak spot. But whereas I would've fought back just a few days prior, I keep on the defensive, focused on countering or dodging each of her attacks. I had always thought I had to become the best sword fighter, by sheer force of the sword alone. But I neglected the fact that I was an Alterer, even though that's where my versatility comes from. So I call them to me. All those who I've sparred with. I summon them, not to have them fight in my stead, but to ask that they pass along some of their power. As they appear, Hua Mulan smiles. And through them, I feel transcendence taking root within me. I feel the duende overtake me."
