I've done my job: I've tracked down and brought the offender before the circuit court, as the mission order stipulated. Now it's up to the judges. Even though I've completed my task, I still like to hang around and find out what will happen to my captive, to find out what fate awaits him. I don't have to stay here. Other detectives leave before the judgment even starts. But for me, staying until the end keeps me grounded. Averting my eyes would probably make my job easier, but seeing the consequences of my own actions has always helped keep me from becoming indifferent. For me, it would be a much worse crime to wind up apathetic or uncaring.\n\nAnubis suddenly appears on his marble throne, and I catch myself holding my breath. The jackal-headed Eidolon looks down at the accused. The young Bravos clenches his fists. He is tense and defiant. Maybe he thinks he's not to blame. But his actions put his companions in danger. He acted without consideration for the wellbeing and safety of his peers. Observing the immature adventurer's disdain, Anubis's eyes narrow. It's a bad attitude and can probably be blamed on his youth. If he keeps this up, he'll definitely be given a verdict that teaches him a lesson. The Eidolon materializes the feather of Ma'at in his palm, then invites the Bravos to climb onto his other palm, which he does. At least he's not the type to run from his responsibilities. That, and the fact that he surrendered without kicking up a fuss, will go in his favor during the weighing..."

He also presides over the Weighing of the Heart, when each individual must report to Osiris about their actions on Earth. He places the heart of the deceased on one pan of the golden scale, where it is weighed on the other pan against a feather of Ma'at, the personification of truth, justice and harmony."
