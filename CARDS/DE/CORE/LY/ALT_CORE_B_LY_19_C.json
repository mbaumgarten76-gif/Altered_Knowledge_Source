          "text": "I sneak onto the bridge quietly to avoid being seen by the Venerable Ones. They have secluded themselves and given express orders not to be disturbed. I stifle a gasp when I see they have summoned Amahle – the Pariah, the Disavowed. I remain completely still, lying on a beam. And even though I can't hear all the words being spoken, I can still make out a few that give me chills. Lies, rebellion, truth, distrust... Normally, no one has the right to summon him without approval from a Matriarch, but ours left the Ouroboros a long time ago, after our excommunication. So, what are they plotting? What do they have to gain by summoning him in secret like this? All knowledge about this Eidolon had been sealed away so that no one could easily summon him. But my grandfather had been the Shepherd of our Saraband, and therefore had access to this knowledge.\n\nAnd even though it was against the rules, he told me his story, or at least a few snippets of his transgressions. Amahle Kalu, the False Prophet... He had recruited some of the clans to turn against the capital's authority. But what the story doesn't mention is that under the guise of a territorial dispute, Kalu's true goal was to free humanity from the influence of the Eidolons. Thankfully, he was stopped. His presence here does not bode well. Does he have some kind of information about the Exiles? Below me, the interview is ending. I risk taking a quick look, just in time to see the Eidolon disappear in a dark mist. Then the Venerable Ones leave the room one by one, leaving me alone and clinging tightly to the structure. I can't stop my heart from pounding furiously. Should I confide in Esme?"
